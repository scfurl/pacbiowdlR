\title{Calculate sequence similarity between two sequences}
\usage{
calculate_sequence_similarity(seq1, seq2, type = "global", score_only = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq1}{First nucleotide sequence as character string}

\item{seq2}{Second nucleotide sequence as character string}

\item{type}{Type of alignment to perform: "global" (default), "local", or "overlap"}

\item{score_only}{Return only the similarity score instead of detailed alignment}
}
\value{
A numeric similarity score (percent identity) between 0 and 100
}
\description{
Calculates the similarity between two nucleotide sequences using pairwise alignment
or string distance metrics as a fallback.
}
