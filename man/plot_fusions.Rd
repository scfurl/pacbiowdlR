\title{Plot genomic fusions using circos plots}
\usage{
plot_fusions(sv_data, highlight = NULL, annotate = FALSE, title = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{sv_data}{A data frame containing fusion data with at least the columns
`chr1`, `chr2`, `start1`, and `start2`. If `annotate=TRUE`, must also include
`bp1_type` and `bp2_type` columns.}

\item{highlight}{Integer vector of row indices to highlight with a thicker black line. Default is NULL.}

\item{annotate}{Logical; whether to color-code links based on fusion types (genic vs. intergenic). Default is FALSE.}

\item{title}{Character; title for the plot. Default is empty string.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL, but creates a circos plot as a side effect.
}
\description{
Creates a circos plot of genomic fusions, with options to highlight specific fusions
and annotate links based on breakpoint types.  Data input should ideally be generated from the
'get_fusions_from_vcf' function
}
\details{
The function creates a circos plot showing genomic fusions. When `annotate=TRUE`,
fusions are color-coded:
- Red: gene-gene fusions (both breakpoints are genic)
- Blue: mixed fusions (one breakpoint is genic, the other intergenic)
- Green: intergenic fusions (both breakpoints are intergenic)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic plot
plot_fusions(fusions)

# Highlight the first three fusions and add annotation
plot_fusions(fusions, highlight = 1:3, annotate = TRUE,
             title = "Genomic Fusions with Highlighted Examples")
}

}
