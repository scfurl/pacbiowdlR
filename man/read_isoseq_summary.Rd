\title{Read an Iso-Seq *summary.txt* report into tidy tibbles}
\usage{
read_isoseq_summary(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{`character(1)`
File path to the *summary.txt* report.}
}
\value{
A named `list` of six tibbles
  \describe{
    \item{`headline`}{Headline counts (*Input transcripts*, *Unique
      transcripts*, *Unique genes*).}
    \item{`counts_isoform`}{Isoform-level classification counts (with `%`
      column if present).}
    \item{`counts_read`}{Read-level classification counts (with `%`
      column if present).}
    \item{`junction_df`}{Splice-junction type breakdown.}
    \item{`gene_df`}{Known *vs.* novel gene counts.}
    \item{`rt_df`}{RT-switching artefact counts.}
  }
}
\description{
`read_isoseq_summary()` parses the plain-text summary produced by SQANTI3,
TALON, or similar long-read annotation tools and converts every metrics
block into a tidy tibble.  The function returns a named list that downstream
helpers such as [`plot_isoseq_overview()`] can consume directly.
}
\details{
Sections are identified by their header lines (e.g. *“Classifications, by
isoform”*).  Everything between two headers is captured and parsed with a
small regular-expression helper, making the function resilient to extra
blank lines or horizontal rulers (`------`).  Percentages in parentheses are
kept when present; otherwise the `pct` column is filled with `NA`.

s <- read_isoseq_summary("LL1_S1.summary.txt")
