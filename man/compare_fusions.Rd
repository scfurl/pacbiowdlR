\usage{
compare_fusions(
  sequenced_fusions,
  liftover_db,
  window_size = 10000,
  output_file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequenced_fusions}{File path or data frame containing sequenced fusions data}

\item{liftover_db}{File path or data frame containing lifted over ChimerDB4 data}

\item{window_size}{Number of base pairs around each breakpoint to consider as a match (default: 10000)}

\item{output_file}{Path to write matching results (optional)}
}
\value{
A data frame containing matching fusions
}
\description{
This function compares fusion breakpoints from sequencing data with fusions from a
liftover database (e.g., ChimerDB4) to identify potential matches. It can accept
both file paths or data frames as input.
