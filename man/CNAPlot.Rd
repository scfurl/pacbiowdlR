\value{
Either a \code{ggplot2} object representing the CNA plot or a list with additional processed data when \code{return_data} is \code{TRUE}.

A numeric value representing the weighted average log2 ratio. Returns \code{NA} if the total weight is zero.

\description{
This function creates a genome-wide copy number alteration (CNA) plot from a BigWig depth file and a VCF variant file.
It computes delta values using one of three methods ("fit", "delta", or "loess"), downsampling the coverage data,
and overlays variant calls as rectangles. A running median trend line is computed on weighted delta values.

Calculates a weighted average log2 ratio for a segment given the per-observation log2 ratios and weights.
}
\details{
The function performs several steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Imports coverage data from the BigWig file using \code{import.bw()} and keeps only standard chromosomes
        (with \code{keepStandardChromosomes()}).
  \item Optionally loads external GC/repeat data when using the "fit" method.
  \item Filters and down-samples the coverage data.
  \item Computes delta values using the specified method:
        \itemize{
          \item \code{"delta"}: subtracts the mean coverage.
          \item \code{"loess"}: fits a LOESS model and computes log2 ratios.
          \item \code{"fit"}: fits a linear model to predict coverage based on GC content and repeat fraction.
        }
  \item Reads and filters variant calls from the VCF file.
  \item Computes genomic offsets via \code{generate_offsets()} (assumed to be defined elsewhere).
  \item Applies weighting to delta values and computes a running median trend line using \code{rollapply()}.
  \item Builds the plot with \code{ggplot2} incorporating points, trend line, variant rectangles, and chromosome boundaries.
}

The function computes the sum of the weights, and if non-zero, returns the weighted average
  of the log2 ratios. If the total weight is zero, \code{NA} is returned.
